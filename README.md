# Open Data Intelligence And Visualization
Open data intelligence and visualisation 

## Abstract
A general data intelligence and visualisation architecture allows users to analyse data irrespective of domain or discipline. Using such technology, one can analyse any data a user has access to irrespective of discipline and find their correlation. Use cases are not limited to data analysis, but it allows to development of data-intensive applications faster and easier.  

## Introduction
Human knowledge is scattered into distinct domains and disciplines, including but not limited to science, engineering, economics, mathematics, and general philosophy. Moreover, the world has a tremendous physiological and intellectual diversity and distinct philosophical views â€” no technology, solution or effective decision making is in isolation from this context with these variables. Hence there is a desperate need for a technology that can augment the ability to derive convergence and apply intelligence and visualise the data in general or otherwise not bound to a domain or discipline. Hence, human civilisation will accelerate the evolution towards a significant future.
