# Open Data Intelligence And Visualization
Open data intelligence and visualisation 

## Abstract
Human knowledge is currently scattered into distinct domains and disciplines, including science, engineering, economics, mathematics, and general philosophy., Moreover, the general human population has a tremendous physiological and intellectual diversity and distinct philosophical views. There is a desperate need for a technology that can augment the ability to apply intelligence and visualization to data in general or otherwise not bound to a domain or discipline.
