Open data intelligence and visualisation 

## Abstract
An intelligence and visualization architecture to apply machine and human intelligence on data in general or otherwise not bounded to a domain or use case. Hence, it can be applied to humans' known and unknown data and connect the dots to explore fantastic discoveries and visualization. 

Human civilization has a desperate need to derive convergence of knowledge currently scattered into distinct domains and disciplines of understanding. Hence humans need technology to augment the general population having different physicological and philosophical views to explore.
