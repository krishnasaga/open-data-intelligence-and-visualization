# Open Data Intelligence And Visualization
Open data intelligence and visualisation 

## Abstract
Human knowledge is currently scattered into distinct domains and disciplines, including science, engineering, economics, mathematics, and general philosophy., Moreover, the general human population has a tremendous physiological and intellectual diversity and distinct philosophical views. There is a desperate need to leverage such technology that can bring intelligence and visualization to apply machine and human intelligence on data in general or otherwise not bound to a domain or use case. Hence, it can be applied to humans' known and unknown data and connect the dots to explore fantastic discoveries and visualization.
