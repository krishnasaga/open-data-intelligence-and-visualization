# Open Data Intelligence And Visualization
Open data intelligence and visualisation 

## Abstract
Human knowledge is currently scattered into distinct domains and disciplines, including science, engineering, economics, mathematics, and general philosophy. The general human population has a tremendous physiological and intellectual diversity and distinct philosophical viewsâ€”moreover, no technology, solution or effective decision making is isolated from these variables. Hence there is a desperate need for a technology that can augment the ability to derive convergence and apply intelligence and visualization to data in general or otherwise not bound to a domain or discipline. Hence human civilization as a whole will accelerate the evolution towards a meaningful and significant future.
