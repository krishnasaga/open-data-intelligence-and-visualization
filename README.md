# Open Data Intelligence And Visualization
Open data intelligence and visualisation 

## Abstract
A general data intelligence and visualisation architecture allows the general public to analyse data irrespective of domain or discipline. Using such technology, one can analyse any data they have access to irrespective of discipline and find their correlation. web3 provides security and reliability of data through oracles and incentivised layers to reword the contributors. Data and visualisation are stored as NFTs. One can bring these NFTs into a metaverse leveraging on the internet of blockchains. Use cases are not limited to data analysis but it allows to devlop data intensive applications levraging on web3.  

## Introduction
Human knowledge is currently scattered into distinct domains and disciplines, including science, engineering, economics, mathematics, and general philosophy. Moreover, the general human population has a tremendous physiological and intellectual diversity and distinct philosophical views â€” no technology, solution or effective decision making is isolated from these variables. Hence there is a desperate need for a technology that can augment the ability to derive convergence and apply intelligence and visualization to data in general or otherwise not bound to a domain or discipline. Hence, human civilization will accelerate the evolution towards a significant future.
